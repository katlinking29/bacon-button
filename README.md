# Bacon Button Project

With the simple click of a button, a user is presented with up to three bacon recipes, based on the number of recipes the user wishes to view, as well as a humorous Ron Swanson quote. The user can click on the link in the recipe, which will open another tab in the browser with the full recipe.
